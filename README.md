# catfacts
A silly program to practice accessing api's in rust, using reqwest, tokio, serde, and argh.
This was also to practice using async.

Basic usage to get a fact:

cargo run


For help and optional arguments, type:

cargo run -- --help

You can also run cargo test, which will verify against a known good input to make sure that everything is working fine.
