# catfacts
A silly program to practice accessing api's in rust, using reqwest and tokio.
This was to learn how to access api's as well as practice using async.

Usage:

cargo run will get you a fact.

For help, type:

cargo run -- --help

You can also run cargo test, which will verify against a known good input to make sure that everything is working fine.
